# What is ChainRules?

 - The ChainRules Project
    - Make an **AD engine agnostic** collection of rules
    - and to see it deployed in all **AD engines**
 - The **ChainRulesCore.jl** Package:
    - Logic for defining rules
    - Packages defining rules only need this.
 - The **ChainRules.jl** Package:
    - The rules for **Base** + **StdLibs**
    - only **AD engines** need this



# What is a `frule`? 

.unfunfact[You can't fuse rrules/pullbacks, because you need the gradient of the step that comes after. Which in turn needs the primal output of this step.]

## ChainRules as an interface for AD

So we need to provide an interface by which one specifies how to call back into AD from a ChainRule.
Probably by providing a method that exactly matches the behavour of `rrule` / `frule`.

But once we make sure every AD package provides a method following that API, then that becomes a common API for all AutoDiff.

We will thus have a easy way to say _use a rule if we have one, or use AD if not_.

---

This means we are not far from being able to provide generic interface for *Optim.jl* etc.
Where you can either define a `rrule` or it will use AD if one is loaded.
